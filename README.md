# Hello, I'm Casper. Over the years, I've cultivated a passion for programming, with a particular focus on front-end development. My heart beats faster when I create the perfect responsive website or web app, with beautiful buttons, animations, and other design elements. I aspire to evolve into a seasoned senior front-end developer. Join me on my coding journey! 🚀
