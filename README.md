# Hello, I'm Casper. Over the years, I've cultivated a passion for programming, with a particular focus on front-end development. My heart beats faster when I create the perfect responsive website or web app, with beautiful buttons, animations and other design elements. I aspire to evolve into a seasoned senior front-end developer. Join me on my coding journey! 🚀

🔭 &nbsp;&nbsp; I’m an **alumnus at Codam Coding College** where I've improved my programming skills in C and C++, which gave me strong fundamental coding skills. At the moment, I'm improving my skills in JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks (Vue.js, Nuxt, React & Next.js). Next up on my learning journey is backend web programming in Nest.js and Laravel.<br /><br />
👨‍💻 &nbsp;&nbsp; **Self-employed webdesigner** at [Post Webdesign](https://postwebdesign.nl/)<br /><br />
💪 &nbsp;&nbsp; **Experienced in designing fully-responsive websites** and webshops for small to medium-sized businesses<br /><br />
