## Codam Coding College

### About Codam Coding College
Currently I'm a student a Codam Coding College in Amsterdam. Codam is a programming school that does things a bit different from regular education in two major ways: 
#### There are no teachers. 
The only way of learning is by sharing knowledge with other students (peer-to-peer learning) and finding resources online. In this way Codam prepares students for the job market where there are also no teachers, but only colleagues and online resources.
#### Personalized curriculum
Everyone has their own pace and interests. That's why there is no one-size-fits-all curriculum at Codam. It totally fine if you want to spend more time on a particular project that has your interest or if you simply need some extra time to understand a new programming concept.
